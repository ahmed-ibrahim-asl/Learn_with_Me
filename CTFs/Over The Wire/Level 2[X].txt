why it's not staright forward to open dashed file ?
	so if i typed "cat file1 - file2" this would leads to displaying 	
	the file1 then file2. BUT if I typed "cat - file2" the stdin will be displayed 
	then file2 so '-' is just delimiter
	between files not refers to stdin right.


	solution -> cat ~/-
